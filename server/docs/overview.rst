Overview
========
Snailwatch is a tool for collecting and visualising performance-oriented data,
such as benchmark results. It consists of a REST server that manages the
measured results and a web dashboard UI for data visualisation.

To get started, you have to :doc:`deploy the server <server>`. After
that you can :doc:`upload benchmark results <collection>` and then
:doc:`display them <dashboard>`.

The complete API documentation for the server can be found
:api:`here <>`.
