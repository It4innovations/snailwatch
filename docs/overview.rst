Overview
========
Snailwatch is a tool for collecting and visualising performance-oriented data,
such as benchmark results. It consists of a REST server that manages the
measured results and a web dashboard UI for data visualisation.

To get started, you have to :doc:`deploy the server <server-deploy>`. After
that you can :doc:`upload benchmark results <collection>`. If you want
to use the web dashboard, you have to :doc:`connect it <dashboard-deploy>`
to the server first. Usage instructions for the dashboard can be found
:doc:`here <dashboard>`.

Complete API documentation for the REST server can be found
:doc:`here <api>`.
