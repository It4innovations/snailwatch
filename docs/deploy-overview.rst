Overview
========
Snailwatch is hosted at |service-url|, but you can also self-deploy it wherever you want.

It consists of an API server and a dashboard. Those two parts are independent of each other and are thus
deployed separately.

Server deployment instructions can be found :doc:`here <server-deploy>`, dashboard deployment is described
:doc:`here <dashboard-deploy>`.
